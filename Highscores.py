""" Racing to the end of the universe!
A simple car game involving pygame. You control a car on a road in which you have to dodge oncomming cars, this will get harder as the game progresses.

this is where the classes for highscores will be stored!

""" revision notes:
- Sprint 1:
    Experimentation of design, what works, what doesnâ€™t ?
- Sprint 2:
    Menu screens added
    Basic game development with little graphics
    Playable gamplay
- Sprint 3:
    Added progressive difficult to the game
    Added a score which updates after each car has passed
    Added a variety of enemy cars with different hit boxes
- Sprint 4:
    Highscore board developed
- Sprint 5:
    Graphics introduced for all models
    Finalisation of any details
